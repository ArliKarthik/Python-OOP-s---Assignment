What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n","   - Programming paradigm where data and functions are bundled into objects, which are instances of classes.\n","   - Helps in code reusability, modularity, and easier maintenance through concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.\n","\n","2. What is a class in OOP?\n","   - A blueprint or template for creating objects; defines attributes (data) and methods (functions).\n","   - Objects created from a class share the structure and behavior defined in the class.\n","\n","3. What is an object in OOP?\n","   - An instance of a class that contains actual values for the attributes defined in the class.\n","   - Can access the class’s methods and perform actions defined in the class.\n","\n","4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n","   - Abstraction: Hides implementation details and shows only the essential features to the user.\n","     - Focuses on what an object does, not how it does it.\n","   - Encapsulation: Hides internal data of an object using private variables and provides access via methods.\n","     - Focuses on how data is protected and controlled within the object.\n","\n","5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n","   - Special methods with double underscores before and after the name (e.g., __init__, __str__) used to define object behavior.\n","   - Allow custom behavior for built-in operations like addition, string conversion, and iteration.\n","\n","6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n","   - Allows a class (child/subclass) to reuse attributes and methods of another class (parent/superclass).\n","   - Promotes code reusability and makes it easier to create hierarchies of related classes.\n","\n","7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n","   - Allows objects of different classes to be accessed through the same interface, enabling the same operation to behave differently.\n","   - Supports method overriding (same method name, different behavior) and operator overloading.\n","\n","8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python.\n","   - Achieved by making variables private using a double underscore prefix (__variable) to restrict direct access.\n","   - Access to private data is provided through getter and setter methods, controlling how data is read or modified.\n","\n","9. What is a constructor in Python?\n","   - A special method __init__() used to initialize an object’s attributes when it is created.\n","   - Automatically called when an object is instantiated, allowing you to set default or initial values.\n","\n","10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n","    - Class Method: Defined using the @classmethod decorator and takes cls as the first parameter.\n","      - Can access or modify class-level attributes, not instance-level attributes.\n","    - Static Method: Defined using the @staticmethod decorator and does not take self or cls.\n","      - Cannot access instance or class attributes directly; used for utility functions related to the class.\n","\n","11. What is method overloading in Python?\n","    - Refers to defining multiple methods with the same name but different number or type of parameters in the same class.\n","    - Python does not support traditional method overloading, but it can be simulated using default arguments or *args/**kwargs.\n","\n","12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n","    - Occurs when a child class provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in the parent class.\n","    - Allows a subclass to change or extend the behavior of the inherited method.\n","\n","13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n","    - @property allows a method to be accessed like an attribute, providing controlled access to private variables.\n","    - Helps implement getter, setter, and deleter methods in a clean and readable way.\n","\n","14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n","    - Allows different objects to be accessed through the same interface, enabling code to be more flexible and extensible.\n","    - Supports code reusability and simplifies maintenance by allowing method overriding and operator overloading.\n","\n","15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n","    - A class that cannot be instantiated and is designed to be a base class for other classes.\n","    - Can contain abstract methods (declared but not implemented) using the @abstractmethod decorator from the abc module.\n","\n","16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n","    - Code Reusability & Modularity: Classes and objects allow code to be reused, and large programs can be organized into smaller, manageable modules.\n","    - Easier Maintenance & Extensibility: Inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism make it easy to update, extend, and debug code without affecting other parts.\n","\n","17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n","    - Class variable: Shared by all instances of the class; defined inside the class but outside any method.\n","      - Changes to the variable affect all objects of that class.\n","    - Instance variable: Unique to each object; defined using self inside methods like __init__().\n","      - Changes affect only that particular object.\n","\n","18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n","    - A class can inherit from more than one parent class, gaining attributes and methods from all of them.\n","    - Enables code reuse and combining behaviors from multiple classes, but can lead to complexity (e.g., method resolution order).\n","\n","19. Explain the purpose of \"__str__\" and \"__repr__\" methods in Python.\n","    - __str__: Returns a readable string representation of an object, meant for end-users.\n","      - Called by print() or str() on an object.\n","    - __repr__: Returns an unambiguous string representation of an object, meant for developers/debugging.\n","      - Called by repr() and used in interactive sessions.\n","\n","20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n","    - Allows a child class to call methods or constructors of its parent class without explicitly naming it.\n","    - Useful for code reuse and handling multiple inheritance, ensuring proper method resolution order (MRO).\n","\n","21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n","    - Called when an object is about to be destroyed (garbage collected), allowing cleanup of resources like files or network connections.\n","    - Helps perform finalization tasks automatically before the object is removed from memory.\n","\n","22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n","    - @staticmethod: Does not take self or cls as the first parameter; cannot access instance or class variables directly.\n","      - Used for utility functions related to the class but independent of class/instance state.\n","    - @classmethod: Takes cls as the first parameter; can access or modify class variables.\n","      - Used for methods that affect the class as a whole rather than individual instances.\n","\n","23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n","    - A child class can override a method of its parent class, allowing the same method call to behave differently depending on the object.\n","    - Enables uniform interface: code can call the same method on different objects without worrying about their specific types.\n","\n","24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n","    - Technique where multiple methods are called in a single statement, with each method returning the object itself.\n","    - Makes code concise and readable, especially for performing multiple operations on the same object.\n","\n","25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n","    - Allows an object of a class to be called like a regular function using parentheses ().\n","    - Enables objects to have function-like behavior, useful for callbacks or custom callable objects."],"metadata":{"id":"GBtM2IGhTldT"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"KbjWdUIxTOoO","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1759299533122,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":444,"user":{"displayName":"Karthik Arli","userId":"16311702913223512127"}},"outputId":"68e6b163-ddd3-40b8-98da-29244e19eacb"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["This animal makes a sound\n","Bark!\n"]}],"source":["#1.
